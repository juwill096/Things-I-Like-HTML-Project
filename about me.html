        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          I'm in the middle of the last year of my 20's. I have a 2 year old
          daughter who thinks she runs my whole life. Prior military
          intelligence but that career was super boring and coding is lit.
          Lastly, I'm left handed and a nervous nail biter.

      <h3>Fitness</h3>
      <p>
        I have always been into some sort of physical fitness rather it be
        sports or the gym. As of 2020 after surviving a terrible car crash where
        my jaw was broken, upon recovery I had lost almost 30 pounds due to not
        being able to eat solid food. Once I recovered I committed myself to
        getting in the gym heavily and since then I've been there almost 4 days
        a week consistently. I had a hard time coming up with workouts on my own
        so I subscribed to
        <a href="https://www.bodybuilding.com/html/join-bodyfit">BodyFit</a> it
        gives me workouts, meal plans, and an overall full guide to my goals.
        Highly recommend.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <h4>Reasons I love the gym life</h4>
        <li>Helps keep my mental clear and unclouded</li>
        <li>Gives me the appetite of Straw Hat Luffy</li>
        <li>I get chiseled like an action figure and beach pics are lit</li>
        <li>Great feedback from my lady lol</li>

      <h3>Gaming</h3>
      <p>
        I have been an avid gamer for as long as I can remember. I finally got a
        PS5 earlier this year, 'twas a long time coming. My favorite game at the
        moment would have to be

        just because of the graphics and plethora of activities. Other than that
        I play a lot of NBA 2k23,
        <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, and
        Elden Ring. Also a huge anime fan, just wanted to squeeze that in
        somewhere.

      <h3>Music</h3>
      <p>
        Music has always been an integral part of my life. From the oldie
        goldies my grandmother used to play over the record player all the way
        to the new
        <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5MS3MvWHJ3lOZPLiMxzOU6"
          >Drake/21 Savage album</a
        >. Music is an escape, takes me to another place and gets me through
        whatever mood or place in life I am in. 3 of the most influential
        artists on my life are Kid Cudi, Big Sean, and J. Cole. Favorite album
        is probably
        <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5FP9keIJnlSCKnkdVOf623"
          >Born Sinner</a
        >
        by J. Cole. Fun fact; I used to rap and have songs on youtube. I will
        not tell anyone how to find them lmao.

      <h3>Hiking</h3>
      <p>
        Hiking is something I picked up in recent years. I find it to be very
        therapeutic and great for getting grounded and clearing my head. Always
        see something rewarding during a hike like a great view from a high
        place or waterfall and area to cool off (in the summer. I'm not from the
        city I was born in a very country area of Georgia so I always enjoy
        getting out of the city and connecting with nature somehow. My favorite
        hike so far has been at La Jolla shores in San Diego.

      <h3>Modeling/Acting</h3>
      <p>
        I began modeling in 2019 in San Diego, CA. One thing for sure this was
        the most uncomfortable decision I've ever made, I didn't know how people
        would take it or if I would get much work. I was wrong to be skeptical,
        I've had nothing but success in every modeling venture I just wish I had
        more time and funds to put into it. Most recently I was a part of
        <a href="https://www.atlantafashionweek.co/"
          >Atlanta Fashion Week 2022</a
        >. As far as acting, I chose modeling as an avenue into acting but have
        not yet had much acting work. However, I did play an extra in Black
        Panther: Wakanda Forever so thats kind of dope if you ask me. There will
        be more to come but first I'm focused on this new exciting career as a
        Front-End Dev.
